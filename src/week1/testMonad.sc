  What is a Monad?
  A 'monad' 'M' is
  a 'parametric type' 'M[T]' with
  two operations,
  'flatMap' and
  'unit', that have to
  satisfy some laws.*/
  /*from:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)
  Formally,
  a 'monad' consists of
  a 'type constructor' 'M' and
  two 'operations',
  'bind' and
  'return'
  (where 'return' is
  often also called 'unit'):

  Examples of Monads
	>>List is
	 a monad with
	   unit(x) = List(x)
	>>Set is
		monad with
		  unit(x) = Set(x)
	>>Option is
		a monad with
		unit(x) = Some(x)
	>>Generator is
		a monad with
		  unit(x) = single(x)
	'flatMap' is
	an operation on each of these types,
	whereas unit in Scala is
	different for each monad.*/

  SigniÔ¨Åcance of the 'Laws' for 'For-Expressions'
  We have seen that
  'monad-typed' expressions are
  typically written as
  'for expressions'.
  What is
  the significance of
  the laws with respect to this?
  1. Associativity says
  essentially that
  one can "inline" nested for expressions:*/
  /** {{{
    * for (
    * y <- (for (
    * x <- m
    * y <- f(x) ) yield y )
    * z <- g(y) ) yield z
    *
    * == for (x <- m
    * y <- f(x)
    * z <- g(y)) yield z
    * }}}
    */
  /*
  2. Right unit says:*/
  /** {{{
    * for (x <- m) yield x
    * == m
    * }}}
    */
  /*
  3. 'Left unit' does not have an analogue for 'for-expressions'.*/
  //*monad laws give
  //*a justification for
  //*refactoring for-expressions
  /*
  Conclusion
  We have seen that
  for-expressions are
  useful not only for collections.
  Many other types also define
  'map',
  'flatMap', and
  'withFilter' operations and
  with them
  'for-expressions'.
  Examples:
    'Generator',
    'Option',
    'Try'.
  Many of the types defining 'flatMap' are
  'monads'.
  (If they also define 'withFilter',
  they are called
  "monads with zero").
  //more rich category then 'monads'
  The three 'monad laws' give
  useful guidance in
  the design of library APIs.
